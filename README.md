###About

The idea for this project was to create a camera app, where the camera screen gets 'overlayed' with visualizations of sound, detected from the phone's microphone.

* Built with React Native for Android and iOS
* Created based on the [React Native Starter Kit](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-app)
* Added camera and photo screens, so uses iOS permissions to access camera and photo library
